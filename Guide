Welcome to the Masternode Harcomia Installation Guide

To complete the installation of the Masternode, you must have this elements :

1000 HCA 1 VPS (Configured on Ubuntu Server 16.04) Last version of HCA Wallet : https://github.com/harcomia/core/releases

Step 1

Send your HCA coins from the exchange or from another wallet directly to the HCA official wallet.

Once the confirmation period is over, the pieces are on the wallet. Create a new receiving address with a meaningful name (for example : MN01).

Send the 1000 HCA coin back to this address of the MN01.

Step 2

While the transaction is confirmed, go to your VPS with "PuTTY" software.

Use the following commands : " apt update ", then, " apt upgrade -y "

Your VPS is now cleaned up and up to date.

Enter the following line :

wget https://github.com/

Then, complete :

bash ./HCA-mn-multi.sh

Step 3

Once the installation is complete, please enter your « TX ID » as requested.
To get it, go to the wallet: Tools -> Debug Console -> Type « masternode outputs » , you get the TX ID and the index (Take care to wait for the confirmation of your transaction to MN01).

Step 4

You have finished ! Recover what the Installation Script gives you and copy it to the « masternode.conf » file.
To access it, go to the wallet : Tools -> « Open configuration file masternodes », there you are. Final Step
Wait until the first rewards appear. If the masternode does not appear in the « Masternode » tab of the wallet, consider restarting the wallet.
